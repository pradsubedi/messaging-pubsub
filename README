This package contains the source code and two test applications for
a publish/subscribe based eventing run-time library, which is a flexible 
interaction and coordination framework to support coupled applications.
The coupled applications can coordinate and interact using this library by
publishing/subscribing messages to/from certain namespaces and topic.
When a subscriber gets notification of a published msg, corresponding handler
functions are triggered.

This library uses margo (mochi+argobots) for the underlying communication between
publishers and subscribers.
